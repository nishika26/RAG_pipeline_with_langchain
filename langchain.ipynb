Get to know the full DOC NYC lineup thanks to Gary Tranc’s list of all screening titles, and read all about one of the Winners’ Circle selections in this interview with In the Rearview filmmaker Maciek Hamela.\\xa0\\nFor now, we have docs aplenty (Albert Brooks! Shere Hite!) and we’re shouting out a couple of more-than-deserving fiction features, too—casting our minds back, for a moment, to Cannes with Aki Kaurismäki’s latest, but also Toronto, with Letterboxd member and actor-writer-filmmaker Joanna Arnow, who has opinions about the phrase “cringe comedy”. Plus: The feeling that the time for watching something has definitely not passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nThe Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Joanna Arnow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed \\nWritten and directed by Joanna Arnow.Seen at TIFF, NYFF, Montclair Film Festival.Available for distribution\\nThe best movie of 2023 about a thirty-something searching for meaning at work (amidst passive-aggressive office politics), home (as a member of a chaotic Jewish family) and play (she is a BDSM sub), Joanna Arnow’s The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed is “droll, fragmented, and full of life,” in the words of BeBraveMorvern. That’s a Letterboxd review Arnow has read—she reads them all, good and not-good, she tells us at TIFF, because “people don’t care about your feelings and are just saying what they actually think. I’m always trying to think about how the scenes work for people. So I just see it as a real learning opportunity to hear everything. Sometimes they’re really funny, too.”\\nShort story writers such as Lydia Davis, Lorrie Moore and Carmen Maria Machado inspire Arnow, along with “the absurd, off-kilter humor” in Tsai Ming-Liang films like Vive L’Amour. She builds vignette-based comedy with a locked-off camera, letting her characters do the work. It’s a minimalist technique with the aim of desensitizing the viewer, so that a simple line or wild moment hits harder, and funnier. “Letting it play out in real, uninterrupted time and seeing the context of the world as it does adds to the humor, makes it more powerful,” she says, “especially for a deadpan-type style.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJoanna Arnow, photographed in Toronto for Letterboxd.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nCreditâ€¦ Gemma Gracewood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust don’t say the words “cringe” and “comedy” in the same breath around her. “I just feel like it’s somehow coded about women. I don’t feel like men get referred to as cringe comedians. It’s like, ‘Oh, because it’s, like, a woman talking about sexuality or putting themselves out there, that’s the word’. Cringe, millennial and raw are all words that I never say myself, and I cringe when people say that about my work.”\\nArnow is also not down for being told she’s “brave” for being naked in so much of the film. “We all sort of wrestle with how to be, in some shape or form, and this is about a character wrestling with sexuality, self, relationships. And I feel like when you say it’s cringe or you say it’s brave, it feels like distancing, whereas I’m hoping that a film invites people in.” Like my colleague Mia, who felt very much invited in by “the 45-second scene where the failgirl lead is arguing with her dinner date about musicals and insists Les Mis is the best! ‘Empty Chairs at Empty Tables’? ‘A Heart Full of Love’? ‘Bring Him Home’? ‘Valjean’s Soliloquy’?!?!” GG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nAlbert Brooks: Defending My Life 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Rob Reiner\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlbert Brooks: Defending My Life\\nDirected by Rob Reiner.Streaming now on Max.HBO Documentary Films\\n“Albert was a shining god of comedy,” director Rob Reiner says in his new documentary focused on the writer, director and actor known for films including Lost in America, Broadcast News and Drive. Playfully named as a reference to Brooks’s 1991 afterlife comedy, the bulk of Reiner’s feature Albert Brooks: Defending My Life is a My Dinner with Andre-style conversation in a restaurant between the duo, best friends who go back sixty years. Ben’s Letterboxd review gives you the primer: “An endearing and well crafted retrospective of a comedy and filmmaking legend that just so happens to be directed by his best friend… who is ALSO a comedy and filmmaking legend.”\\nWe take a journey through Brooks’s career, beginning as a stand-up and variety performer who would go on in front of a live audience with an act that he had never rehearsed before. There’s plenty of reflection on his illustrious cinema career in front and behind the camera, including the prescience of his first directed feature Real Life, which depicted reality television before reality television even existed, and Modern Romance, which Stanley Kubrick said was the movie about jealousy he wished he had made. Reflects Thomas in his review of the documentary, “Albert Brooks has always made me feel like it’s beautiful to be the most vulnerable and belligerent parts of yourself.”\\nAlong the way, we get talking heads from Brooks’s collaborators and contemporaries discussing what his work has meant to them. Jon Stewart describes Brooks as “the first alternative comic”, while Sharon Stone calls him “the caviar of comedy”. For Steven Spielberg, he’s a “comedic tornado”, and Judd Apatow does them all one better by declaring Brooks “the funniest man in the world”. As any admirer of his can expect, the documentary is rife with Brooks’s trademark wry humor, with him joking at one point that “it took this to finally hear a compliment. Can’t wait till I’m dead!” It’s certainly a success for fans like Barton, who says, “I love Albert Brooks so much I could have watched eight hours of this. Anyone who worships this man’s comedy is going to be in heaven.” MB\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nThe Disappearance of Shere Hite 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Nicole Newnham\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Disappearance of Shere Hite\\nDirected by Nicole Newnham.In select US theaters November 17.IFC Films and Sapan Studios\\nAlthough we previously highlighted The Disappearance of Shere Hite in our Best of Sundance 2023 roundup last February, the groundbreaking work of the titular feminist author cannot be emphasized, championed and—sadly—mourned enough. In Nicole Newnham’s latest documentary (she previously co-directed the acclaimed Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution), Dakota Johnson narrates the story of Shere Hite, a woman whose rigorous sexology research spawned her 638-page book, The Hite Report on Female Sexuality, in 1976.\\nHite went on to write several more nonfiction books on similar topics, but the United States’s conservative atmosphere of the 1980s began to stymie her spirit—Newnham details the misogynistic backlash with an acute empathy for Hite that the culture at the time cruelly did not afford her. As such, Hite renounced her US citizenship in 1995 and disappeared herself to Germany. Almost thirty years later, her tale is finally told through a cogent combination of textured archival footage, personal correspondence and infuriating scenes of Hite being lambasted in bad faith by men on national television.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Letterboxd reviews, the spurned sexologist’s efforts are thankfully beginning to be acknowledged by a new generation of feminists, with Alejandra Martinez calling the doc “especially poignant in a post-Roe v. Wade world hellbent on keeping progress at bay.” Meanwhile, Panaceaa says, “So glad this documentary came out so I could finally learn about someone so monumental. Why I didn’t learn about Shere Hite while going to a mostly women’s university is beyond me.” The Reappearance of Shere Hite is upon us! MLV\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nFallen Leaves 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Aki KaurismÃ¤ki\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFallen Leaves\\nWritten and directed by Aki Kaurismäki.In select US theaters November 17.MUBI\\nFinnish softie Aki Kaurismäki has a template for his movies. An odd coupling to match his odd tone. Scenes with silence, deadpan line deliveries, and often two blue collar people in their own thoughts, barely in conversation with each other. The settings are dive bars, small apartments with mid-century furniture to die for, or a karaoke bar. Chuckles are had throughout a short runtime and then suddenly you find your heart broken or your heart lifted by the end. He is a quirky, reliable, and singular filmmaker and Fallen Leaves is his newest. In it, Alma Pöysti is a service industry worker struggling to get hours and Jussi Vatanen is a construction worker with a drinking problem. They go on a date to a movie you’d never guess, and their potential coupling has ups and downs over the 81-minute runtime.\\nFallen Leaves is perfectly autumnal and wintery in its isolation and yearning. Weaved into the story are news reports and color schemes that reinforce the war in Ukraine. Reminding viewers that Finland borders Russia. The current events of fall 2023 only heighten those fictionalized broadcasts as global attention on Ukraine has started to wane.\\nKaurismäki films are simple and unique, once you’re hooked, David Sims calls them the “best medicine for whatever ails ya.” If you’ve not seen one of his films yet, many Letterboxd members are giving handy comparisons. ANNBNNY calls Fallen Leaves, “Before Sunrise for the working class.” Maxime labels it “La La Fin-Land.” And Fran Hoepfner references Blink-182 with her summary, “work sucks, I know.” That smörgåsbord of comps should be all you need to watchlist Fallen Leaves. BF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nMenus-Plaisirs Les Troisgros 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Frederick Wiseman\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMenus-Plaisirs Les Troisgros\\nDirected by Frederick Wiseman.In select US theaters beginning November 22 at Film Forum.Zipporah Films\\nAcclaimed documentarian Frederick Wiseman has been one to watch since before most of our readers were born. His first documentary Titicut Follies was released in 1967, and 43 documentaries later (with six total in our official top docs list) at the age of 93, Wiseman gives us Menus-Plaisirs Les Troisgros. He typically makes super-sized, fly-on-the-wall studies of institutions, and the approach to Menus Plaisir is little different from his norm—including its four-hour runtime—but the institution here is the Troisgros patriarchy and the business is the art of cuisine at its Michelin star-worthy restaurants in France.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStructured as though a single day of service, Wiseman is most interested in the care of attention to granular detail, exploring the culinary world from markets to foraging, from farm to plate. This is no Boiling Point or The Menu: the zen-like focus of the chefs illuminated by splendid natural light brings a timeless, tranquil atmosphere. Expect little drama, except for when a dish needs more salt or less spice. The exact science of food has been refined for centuries and the film emphasizes passing that knowledge to the next generation. Fine dining is always peaking, so greater techniques are always on the way.\\n“There are conversations in this film that I will never have and would never think to have yet will be lodged in the creases of my brain for the foreseeable future,” writes Chris Cabin on the numerous debates between the restaurateurs who are able to conceptualize entire menus without tasting the delectable combinations. The food porn made David Hiltscher hungry, as he notes: “If there ever was a movie that screams for a food pairing it’s this one. Given the movie’s length there’d be time enough for a nine course meal at least.” Above all, we can live in peace knowing that Wiseman’s production had the best craft services in film history.

[However], in some cultures like Hawaiians and Polynesian cultures or Native cultures, those people are thought of as gifted.”\\nKahunahana’s debut feature, Waikiki, is “unlike any other film that we’ve seen before that’s about or takes place in Hawaii,” according to Scope 240. Instead of the usual lÅ«’au-and-hibiscus view of life in a tourist-trap, Kahunahana’s surrealistic story explores the tiring, hardscrabble lives of Natives who can no longer afford to exist in their own homelands. The tale pivots around Kea (played by Danielle Zalopany of Hawaii Five-O fame), a woman holding down several jobs—two focused on serving foreign tourists, the third on bringing a Hawaiian world view into elementary education—while living out of her van.\\nAs she descends into a kind of madness fueled by the colonialist-capitalist world around her, she is shadowed by Wo, a fellow houseless local whose meaning in her life unfolds slowly. Waikiki shares the same, grungy magical realism feel of Kahunahana’s successful short, Lahaina Noon (now included in the Criterion Collection). The film had its festival run in the online-only Covid years, which is why you’re only just hearing about it now that it’s reached (some) cinemas.

So while the blockbusters enjoy their champagne problems, get your watchlists open for this month’s selection of gems, hand-picked by our Journal crew… Ready for it?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nWe Grown Now 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Minhal Baig\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe Grown Now \\nWritten and directed by Minhal Baig.Screening at AFI Fest October 26 and 28.Sony Pictures Classics\\nComing-of-age fans, it’s time to open up your hearts a little wider as Minhal Baig’s wondrous sophomore feature We Grown Now is here. The film received its world premiere at TIFF this year, where it won the Changemaker Award as selected by the Next Wave committee. “The entire time I had a bubble in my throat and that bubble burst during the last scene,” writes Letterboxd member AJ in a 4.5-star review—a feeling I wholly echo for this deeply felt movie.\\nBaig remembers how joyous making We Grown Now was, as the sweet young actors Blake Cameron James and Gian Knight Ramirez, playing Malik and Eric respectively, held the keys to the castle. “It was so much fun to come to set every day and realize that two ten-year-olds were my boss. They got to tell me what to do,” the director says. “They were so ready to live in this world. They were the light of the movie.” We follow these two best friends as they navigate their changing world as lifelong residents of the Cabrini-Green public housing complex in 1992 Chicago—an enormous story for these growing boys.\\n“We had this process of taking off the coat of the character at the end of day,” Baig explains. “I wanted them to preserve themselves in the process and separate themselves from the heavy and dramatic scenes.” Still, there is light and beauty: We Grown Now nods to Spike Lee’s Crooklyn and much of Paolo Sorrentino’s work in the emotional and visual sensibilities of working with child actors and a sense of home. The filmmaker summarizes the emotional maximalism beautifully: “I wanted to just make the world feel big like it does for these kids at that age.” EK\\nWATCH: FOUR FAVORITES WITH MINHAL BAIG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nWhen Evil Lurks 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Demián Rugna\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Evil Lurks (Cuando acecha la maldad)\\nWritten and directed by Demián Rugna.In select US theaters now and streaming on Shudder October 27.IFC Films/Shudder\\nFor those of you squeamish about violence towards children and/or animals, be forewarned: When Evil Lurks is not for the faint of heart. This Argentinian horror from Terrified director Demián Rugna wastes no time in making you pull out the barf bags when two farmer brothers in a remote village come upon a pus-leaking, boil-covered man they describe as a “rotten” and hastily decide to dispose of him. The evil contained in this possessed entity won’t rest that easily, and those who have been in his proximity begin to experience one atrocity after the next.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPart of the genius of When Evil Lurks is its clever doling out of just enough knowledge to the audience to scare us out of our minds while not spending too much time on the how and the why to the point of demystifying the terror. “A Fulci-esque descent into nightmare with an elaborate mythology just out of reach,” FakeRobHunter writes, “and while I would love a follow-up digging into things even more, the film is perfect as is.”\\nJustine describes the film as being “about personal responsibility and the myriad ways humanity is deluded into believing we are above or somehow outside of the brutality of the natural world,” hitting on the underlying, primal concept that we’re all doomed and all these characters are doing is staving off the inevitable. As Tasha says, “the characters don’t have a hope, innocence won’t save anyone, and God is presumed to be dead,” and if that sounds like the kind of relentlessly bleak nihilism that you love having keep you up at night, When Evil Lurks is sure to satisfy your appetite.

The ‘Song Film’ began as improvisational violin performances by Kishi Bashi while visiting landmark incarceration camps around the US that were established by Executive Order 9066, which persecuted Japanese-Americans following the Pearl Harbor attacks in WWII. Out of those performances grew his fourth album (of the same title, released in 2019) and now a passion-project feature documentary co-directed by Justin Taylor Smith.\\nOmoiyari is a Japanese word that means to have sympathy or compassion for another. For Kishi Bashi, the profound impact of putting himself in the shoes of the detainees brings him to the way history is repeating itself with refugees interned at the US border today. The violent act of government stripped the assimilated Japanese-Americans of their American identities—to the point where Kishi Bashi himself feels distant from his own Japanese and American identity, despite having no relatives at the camp. The documentary acts as an essential piece of education, an urgent amplifier of activism and a reclamation of an artist’s soul.\\n“[A] quietly devastating dissection of what it means to be a bi-cultural artist, but moreso, a bi-cultural person, in America today,” describes Joshua. In a politicized country where policy is too often driven by emotion and fear, the acknowledgment of history—especially the most difficult-to-take parts—is more important than ever. For those who will be introduced to Kishi Bashi through his debut film, he tells us that he “hope[s] viewers will continue to cultivate empathy for diverse artistic voices. It’s a beautiful world out there!” Omoiyari to all.

Maryam Keshavarz writes, directs and produces a semi-autobiographical story centered on a young queer woman, Leila (Layla Mohammadi), her non-traditional, business-focused mom Shirin (Niousha Noor), and her many, many brothers. A heart transplant and a surprise pregnancy (to a Broadway actor played by Tom Byrne in Hedwig drag) throw several cats among these New York City pigeons, leading to a “gut-wrenchingly beautiful” third act, according to Selin.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeshavarz also won the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at Sundance for a script that has attracted some lower Letterboxd ratings for its flightiness—but fans reckon it is the ideal framework for Iranian family complexity. Corey suggests The Persian Version is “structured in a way that thematically parallels the journey of searching for a story. The first half is sprawling, panicked, cliche, and as the film progresses it becomes focused, specific, and an overall beautiful stream-of-consciousness family legacy drama.”\\nMarlo agrees, praising Keshavarz’s “joyous” approach: “While I may understand the criticism behind the multiple narratives and time jumps, the overall effect of it works extremely well for me… Keshavarz abstracts the idea of family history, which works particularly well for Persian culture and the secrets we have kept as we fled a dying country.” Several Letterboxd members have been having moments of true recognition: of boyfriends, and cousins among the cast. On that note, there is also an abundance of thirst for one family member in particular: Jerry Habibi (we see you, SixInchBone, VaporwaveVixen and Eminemifhewas). GG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nBeyond Utopia 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Madeleine Gavin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond Utopia\\nDirected by Madeleine Gavin.Screening for two nights theatrically across the US on October 23–24 before releasing November 3.Fathom Events and Roadside Attractions\\nAnother major Sundance winner—of the prized Audience Award, as well as a spot on our best of the fest 2023 round-up—is the unforgettable Beyond Utopia. Offering a rare glimpse into the relatively new country of North Korea, this documentary bravely uncovers unthinkable horror stories that the Kim regime has infamously gone to great lengths to cover up (and in some cases, amplify). It’s difficult enough to acquire footage from within the isolated republic, even more so to sneak it out, so the film’s existence in itself is a revelation. On top of this, director Madeleine Gavin (also an accomplished narrative feature editor) and team have imbued their cinematic wonder with empathy, allowing interviewees to speak for themselves, to show and tell their own harrowing histories.\\nA sampling of the subjects: a mother in South Korea, desperate to reconnect with her teenage son, who’s gone missing after attempting to join her in Seoul; an author who, after successfully defecting, writes a book about the brainwashing and torture she endured; an elderly woman coming to the realization that the past 80 years of her life have been a carefully constructed lie; a pastor helping a multi-generational North Korean family escape, by way of a perilous ten-hour-long journey through the Laotian mountains.\\nIt’s exactly this explicit focus on the Korean citizens that makes Beyond Utopia so powerful. “One of the most moving [documentaries] I’ve seen this year,” writes Yilin in a five-star review. “A lot of what we hear about North Korea is about Kim Jong Un, his nuclear missiles, that we actually rarely stop and think about the people of North Korea themselves.” Nevaq, who recently caught the doc at MIFF, agrees: “The level of specific intimate detail gives an understanding that no amount of bland geopolitical news stories about the latest threats or tensions, the usual format of engagement with North Korea for a Western audience, can ever convey.” MLV\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nAndragogy 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Wregas Bhanuteja\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/andragogy./ (/budi.pekerti/)\\nWritten and directed by Wregas Bhanuteja.Screening at the inaugural SXSW Sydney as part of the 2023 Features Competition.Kaninga Pictures\\nYou can’t even queue for a steamed rice cake at your favorite market stall anymore without becoming embroiled in a nationwide social media scandal that puts your job and your family’s reputation on the line. Yes, Lydia Tár fans, /andragogy./ (‘/budi.pekerti/’) is another “cancel culture” film, one firmly rooted in the experiences of the person being canceled: in this case, a kind and smart Indonesian school counselor who is on track for a promotion to Deputy Principal.\\nBu Prani (a luminous Sha Ine Febriyanti) is the star of Wregas Bhanuteja’s second feature film—and she’s a star in her students’ lives, too, using a beautiful form of counseling she calls “reflection” rather than punishment. She also holds together a cramped household consisting of her influencer son, activist daughter and bipolar husband. Bu Prani’s life comes undone one day when a quick market visit leads to a discussion about line-skipping, in which a Javanese word is misinterpreted into a slur that spreads fast thanks to bystanders’ mobile phones.\\nFrom there, it’s a wholly absorbing drama involving “clarification statements”, indie media, school politics and more. Ryan, who saw the film at TIFF, was enthralled: “For the entire runtime nothing else mattered. My full attention was in this film’s hands, it toyed with my emotions and by the end you just feel exhausted (in a good way).” Zachary also approves: “Seeing how lives can be affected by strangers who don’t know anything about you in this digital age was very powerful. Hopefully this Reflection will help how social media is perceived.” GG \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\nHangdog 2023\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Directed by Matt Cascella\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHangdog\\nDirected by Matt Cascella, written by Cascella and Jen Cordery.Currently on the festival circuit.Big Shins Films\\nEvery now and again, Letterboxd members get to enjoy the sweet secret of being among the first dozen people to log a movie. I’m one of eighteen, at the time of writing, to have seen Hangdog, a low-budget, highly delightful film about a stolen dog, crippling depression and learning to love both yourself and small-town life, from director Matt Cascella and his co-writer, Jen Cordery.\\nDesmin Borges plays Walt, a depressed advertising creative struggling to adapt to a slower existence after moving with his partner Wendy (Kelly O’Sullivan, Saint Frances) to her hometown in coastal Maine. Wendy still gets to go to the city for work, and trouble comes when Walt is charged with looking after—and definitely not losing—her beloved dog. Tony (the mutt) goes missing during an outing to the local weed shop for a depression cure, and Walt is going to need the help of every local he’s so far tried to avoid getting to know.\\n“Charming, engrossing and joyful rom-com whodunnit. Set (and shot!) in Portland, Maine with an absolutely fantastic cast,” writes Ian. “It’s chock full of wry humor, quiet wisdom and eloquent gripes on human nature,” according to Corey. With music by Walter Martin of The Walkmen and Jonathan Fire*Eater fame, and the excellent Catherine Curtin and Barbara Rosenblat co-starring as Maine locals, Hangdog is trotting around the regional US film festival circuit (Provincetown, Maine and New Hampshire so far) and worthy of many more woof-loving eyes. Currently available for distribution, let’s hope it’s not on watchlists for too long.

This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: tell me the names of all the film festivals\\n=========\\nContent:  With the London and New York film festivals just wrapped...\\nSource: https://letterboxd.com/journal/watchlist-this-october-2023/\\n\\nContent:  America’s largest documentary festival, DOC NYC\\nSource: https://letterboxd.com/journal/watchlist-this-november-2023/\\n\\nContent:  Festival Circuit\\nSource: https://letterboxd.com/journal/watchlist-this-october-2023/\\n\\nContent:  SXSW Sydney—AEC’s list of the inaugural 2023 lineup, Festiville’s list of all the films playing AFI Fest 2023, TIFF's 2023 Next Wave slate\\nSource: https://letterboxd.com/journal/watchlist-this-october-2023/\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\n",
